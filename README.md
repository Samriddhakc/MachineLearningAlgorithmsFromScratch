# MachineLearningAlgorithmsFromScratch

GOAL: The project aims to implement machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistical regression, MultiLayerNueralNetwork, Support
Vector Machine(SVM),NaiveBayes Classifier, RandomForest, K means clustering,decision trees, and simple reccomender system from scratch.

MOTIVATION: In the world of deep learning frameworks, it is easy to ignore important details about an algorithm and why it actually works. 
While on large scale, frameworks can be crucial, I believe that without a understanding of the foundation it is difficult to be a 
good machine learning practioner. Thus, I want to understand how Machine Learning/Deep learning works while also apply it to
real world situation.
