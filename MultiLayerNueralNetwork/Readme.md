This project is an attempt to make a nueral network with 1 hidden layer from scatch using numpy and some other libraries without using explicitly deep learning framework. 

For sanity check, with a dummy generated dataset with two labels the results are as follows:

Throughout the project, I implement the gradient descent and backpropagation algoritm correctly. Also, loss functions such as  relu, sigmoid, L2_Loss, and gradient descent algos such as rmsprop, adam, and gradient descent with momentum has been implemented from scratch to compare the results which shows that adam works the best among all of them, as expected.
