This project is an attempt to code Linear Regression from scartch for multiple variables. 

For multilinear regression, method of normal equation (Exact Method), and method using the gradient descent algorithm have been coded. 

Dummy dataset for LR has been used to check the effectiveness of the algorithm. 
 Black: Exact solution     Red: Grad Descent
